# Library-Assistant-Chatbot
This project is an AI-powered library assistant chatbot using the Groq generative AI API. It helps users find books by asking about their preferences (e.g., genre, purpose). The chatbot offers tailored recommendations from a predefined list and keeps the conversation library-focused, ensuring a helpful and engaging experience.
